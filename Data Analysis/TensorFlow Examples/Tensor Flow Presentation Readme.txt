This was a presentation presented to a graduate class with additional instruction. It explores surface useage of Tensor with three quick examples. Each dataset used is provided except for the traffic signs example, to which a link is provided. 
This was created in one afternoon and doesn't demonstrate the breadth of my own TF use and experience. 
The final example of image recognition is ill fit by TF, indicating that a much more indepth tool is necessary in that example.
