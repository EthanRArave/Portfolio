A fun project aimed at quickly learning to scrape specific html information. While I am capable of making a comparable Markov-chaining process as the library here, the time constraints on the project and similar quality of results meant that there was little to gain by doing so. 
This is a fun demonstration of a self-directed project and problems solved from the ground up.
