An expressive violin graph layered to allow comparisons of two dairy products' closing prices over one year. This opperates as a fancier box-plot, allowing one to ask questions when long protrusions and odd shapes crop up, on top of understanding central tendencies. 
The line was meant to help track trends in this information dense graph, but it does cut into the visual clarity I was striving for, somewhat.
