A proof of concept of a relatively clean interactive 3d plot. This pulls together multiple datasets for each axis and the point size. That said, these trends are over whatever time-frames I could find, meaning the years of the data of each axis/the size of the points do not match up; this graph does not reflect whatever current trends may exist in these areas (the data is not available as up-to-date in some cases).
