This is a series of visualizations made custom for the Montana DMV exploring a set of questions around luxury vehicle locations and their ties to potential tax dodging. 
The datasets here are pulled from disparate APIs centered around the DMV's customers database.  
The bottleneck of this project was classifying car types from manufacturers to create buckets, which was done with care, but is a subjective aspect of the project and potentially prone to error.
