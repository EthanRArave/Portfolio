This is a series of visualizations made custom for the Montana DMV exploring a set of questions around luxury vehicle locations and their ties to potential tax dodging. 
The datasets here are pulled from disparate APIs centered around the DMV's customers database.  
This is a 200,000 observation subset of the original set of nearly 2 million rows, to comport with githubâ€™s size protocols for files.
The bottleneck of this project was classifying car types from manufacturers to create buckets, which was done with care, but is a subjective aspect of the project and potentially prone to error.
